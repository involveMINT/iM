# 4. Multi-Image Upload for POIs

Date: 2024-04-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current image upload for POIs is limited (4 images, selected one at a time). Changing the form to accept more images, all selected at once, would be useful for users.

## Decision

Make necessary changes to POI, file-handling, and UI elements to implement feature.

## Justification

The feature is likely to improve the user experience significantly, and improve the quality of POIs.

## Consequences

Only one upload box is displayed at a time. More photos may be uploaded, resulting in increased storage, bandwidth & resource usage. Unintended consequences may occur in further testing.
